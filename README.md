# Final-Group-Project

Each of these programs use a hashing method to sort a long list of words by giving them a unique value and putting them into an array list. Our group consisted of four members who each had to use one of the hashing programs taught to us in our class to complete this assignment. Each program uses Java in order to achieve this goal and has their own sperate README file in order to better explain their specific method.
